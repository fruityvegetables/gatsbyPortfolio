## About me

#### My journey down the rabbit hole

The starting line for me was being a kid interested in science.  
I went through some plateaus growing up, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life.  
When I first went to college, it was as an engineering major. I lost motivation, because the classical form of engineering didn't pique my interests. I changed majors a few times, but ultimately ended up quitting because of a lack of direction.  
I returned in 2015, and graduated in 2017 with an Associates of Applied Science in Computer Programming. In my return, it was intended for me to become a database specialist - but that degree got eliminated from San Antonio College due to a lack of enrollment.  
It didn't stop there though. College introduced me to C++, Java, PHP, and the LAMP stack; as well as HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  
It left a lot of gaps that would have been really hard to fill in by teaching ones self.  
After taking a year off and bartending, driving, and doing other customer service/construction jobs, I decided to take a larger leap and join a boot camp program for software development.  
This desire to learn more and grow came from realizing I didn't want my life to be about coasting through it until the end. For some that is the answer, but it left me restless to think of my life being that way.  
It also came about from a close friend of mine having a psychotic break and being diagnosed with schizophrenia. I also had a dear Uncle pass away from a malignant cancer that ended up in his bones, at the age of 70. That was far too young and early in my life for me to sit ambly by.  
I chose The University of Texas at Austin's program for Full-stack Web Development to further my knowledge, where I learned the MERN stack.  
There, I learned just how important other frameworks and technologies are for web development in this day and age. It truly opened my eyes to the world of coding, and placed me in the market for a job.  
It also made me realize that I'm more of a back-end programmer as opposed to a front-end one.  
The front-end is definitely a glorious place to see your code come to life, and can be a very tricky and ever-changing skill to master. It does require some pixel-perfect problem solving.  
But, for me - that is just the start of the "rabbit hole". I have an unquenchable desire to learn more science, math, and engineering until I am helping our fragile bodies become better.  
So, help me reach my goal of working in bionics or biomedical engineering. It definitely won't be possible to do alone.

#### TL;DR

_My experiences have led me to learning Data Science and Biomedical Engineering, with an ultimate goal of being in a research & development role._
